WORK IN PROGRESS, CONCEPT ONLY

"Our proposed digital platform aims to revolutionize the way governments make decisions by using a community-driven, evidence-based approach. By harnessing the power of the scientific method, the platform allows anyone to submit evidence and criticism, ensuring that decisions are made based on the best available information. The platform also includes a funding pool to support research and projects, and constantly improves through the discussion of the algorithms behind it. The ultimate goal is to create a transparent and fair system that is open to all and that encourages participation and community engagement."

The proposal is for a platform that allows for the community as a whole to submit evidence and ideas, with experts and everyday users collaborating to create the best laws and policies. The platform would use three algorithms, the Sci algorithm, the Sort algorithm and the Consensus algorithm, to ensure that the most accurate and reliable information is being used.

The Sci algorithm would analyze research papers and studies admitted to the platform, identifying any weaknesses or problems with the evidence being submitted. This would include checks such as whether a reference is required in a certain section, if a reference is weak, if the sample size is only suitable in certain regions, and if a study backs up a certain claim.

The Sort algorithm would use the information from the Sci algorithm to sort the studies and users by evidence and problems found. This would be used as a measure of how trustworthy the users are.

The Consensus algorithm would use both the Sci and Sort algorithms to decide when a plan has enough evidence to be accepted as true or the best option. For example, a proposal would be considered the best option for a specific purpose in practice when compared to alternatives.

Users would be able to flag any problems they find with the studies or evidence being submitted, and the community would be able to weigh in on the inner workings of the platform just like they can with laws and topics, improving the platform and relying on a loop between the people, evidence, and the platform to make it become more secure and truthful.

The reputability of users would be used in the sorting algorithm, but not in the consensus algorithm, as that uses evidence and reason only.
This would remove the bias of measuring worth by how often a person is correct, rather than how they make decisions and learn from them.
Otherwise users could simply post random true information or make safe predictions to keep their reach high.

The platform constantly improves itself by including all topics related to its functioning within the forums of the platform itself, with the consensus algorithm being used to make decisions on changes to the platform, which are organized and implemented by the community.

### Algorithms

Sci - Analyzes research papers and studies admitted to the platform, identifying any weaknesses or problems with the evidence being submitted.
Sort - Uses the information from the Sci algorithm to sort the studies and users by evidence and problems found.
Consensus - Uses both the Sci and Sort algorithms to decide when a plan has enough evidence to be accepted as true or the best option.
